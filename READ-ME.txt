Hi, 

Inside each folder you will find a READ-ME file.

Make sure you read it before using the profiles in that folder.

It will tell you which bot to use for that particular folder.

Profiles created after 09/10/12 will have a popup window shortly after you start the profile.

The popup will give you instructions for that profile. Each popup and profile are different, so read them the first time you use each profile.

After 30 seconds, most of the popups will automatically disappear and the bot will proceed.

There are a few profiles with popups that will require your assistance. You will be warned when you start the profile, if your assistance will be needed.
 
Otherwise, press continue if you have read the popup.

Thank you.
